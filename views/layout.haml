          %h1 Adhearsion is...
          %p
            Adhearsion is a new way to write voice-enabled applications. It's not just an API or library &mdash; it's a
            %strong fully-featured framework
            , the first of its kind, designed for maximal code reuse and intuitiveness. The name "Adhearsion" is a combination of "adhesion" and "hear" because Adhearsion shines best when integrating technologies with voice.

          %h1 It's modern
          %p
            Adhearsion uses the high-level
            %a{:href => "http://ruby-lang.org"} Ruby programming language
            and has a comprehensive regression test suite. In the age of the social web, what other technologies are more social than voice? Adhearsion aims to help merge this so-called "Web 2.0" world with the previously untamable telephony world.

          %h1 It's intuitive
          %p
            Voice applications don't have to be hard. Adhearsion abstracts much of the complicated telephony domain, allowing you to focus on what's really important: the
            %em business
            domain. Take a look at the
            %a{:href => "/examples"} Examples
            to see what we mean.

          %h1 It's open-source
          %p We take open-source software seriously. The telecom industry, above all, needs fresh innovative talent and Adhearsion's here to foster it. This is one of the final major frontiers for open-source to truly make a transformative impact and now is an exciting time to be a part of it.

          %h1 We think it's fun
          %p Many hackers' faces light up the first time they run code which makes the cell phone in their pocket ring. Whether you're a veteran telephony engineer or a web developer wanting a new experiment to do over the weekend, we think Adhearsion is enough of a departure from classical telephony to tickle your fancy.
